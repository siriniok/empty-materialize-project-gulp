# Empty Materialize CSS Project with Gulp

Empty [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) Project. It includes a Sass compiler and a set of Panini HTML templates for you. [Panini](https://github.com/zurb/panini) is a super simple flat file generator for use with Gulp. It compiles a series of HTML pages using a common layout. These pages can also include HTML partials, external Handlebars helpers, or external data as JSON or YAML.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (6.9.1 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

To setup the project, first clone it with Git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:siriniok/empty-materialize-project-gulp.git projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass and HTML template compiler. They will re-run every time you save a Sass or HTML temaplate file.
